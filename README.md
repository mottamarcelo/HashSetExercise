In an online course portal, each user has a unique code, represented by an integer number.
Each instructor on the portal can have several courses, and the same student can unenroll from as many courses as they like. Thus, the total number of students in an instructor's course is not simply the sum of the students in all the courses he or she has, as there may be repeated students in more than one course. Instructor Alex has three courses, A, B and C, and wants to know his total number of students.
Your program should read the students from Alex's courses A, B and C, then display his total number of students, as shown in the example.
